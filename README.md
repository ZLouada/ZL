# TrackerGoal

TrackerGoal is a focused productivity suite designed around your goals. It helps you measure intention instead of just work by allowing you to track your time, visualize your progress, and build streaks for recurring habits. It also features an integrated AI assistant powered by Gemini to help you manage your goals and tasks conversationally.

## Features

- **Goals that mean something:** Capture what matters with categories, priorities, target hours, and deadlines.
- **One-tap timers:** Start a focused session in a single click. Pause, resume, or log time manually.
- **Streaks & habits:** Turn recurring goals into daily wins with streak tracking that keeps you honest.
- **Insightful analytics:** See exactly where your hours go — by goal, by category, by day, or by week.
- **Progress at a glance:** Track target hours vs. logged time with clean, motivating progress bars.
- **AI Chat Assistant:** Converse with an AI to create goals, tasks, plans, list your active goals, or control timers directly from the chat interface.

## AI Chat Capabilities

The built-in chat server located in `server/chat.ts` connects to Google Gemini 2.5 Pro and features tool-calling. It maps conversational requests to your database so you can manage the application naturally:
- **createGoal**: Tell the AI to create a new goal.
- **createTask**: Break a goal down into actionable tasks.
- **createPlan**: Let the AI automatically draft a plan of tasks.
- **listGoals**: Query the state of your active goals.
- **controlTimer**: Start or stop your pomodoro/timers.
